# Ensemble_Learning_Project
 
Worked on a project from a top ridesharing company focusing on driver team attrition to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on their attributes like demographics, tenure and performance.

Project involves:
- Exploratory Data Analysis:
>- Understanding the data identifying shape and data types
>- Feature Engineering
>- Data condenstation to make each row represent one driver's data
>- Missing value treatment along with Univariate and Bivariate analysis
- Data Preprocessing: KNN Imputation, Class Imbalance Treatment, Encoding, Standardization
- Model Building: Bagging and Boosting Algorithm Models
- Results Evaluation: Classification Report and ROC AUC Curve
- Actionable Insights and Business Recommendations
